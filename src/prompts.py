                                - Your logic must follow this guidance:
                                    - If 3 or more of the last 5 posts are stand-alone, consider recommending a new series.
                                    - If a recent series just ended, check if its topic could justify a follow-up.
                                    - If recent stand-alone posts share a common theme, consider starting a new series based on that.
                                    - If none of the above applies, or Carlos needs more thematic variety, continue with stand-alone posts.
